        <b>Description:</b>
        Checks if AMS results are close to OVMS and OpenVino benchmark app.

        <b>Input data:</b>
        - AMS
        - model
        - configuration

        <b>Expected results:</b>
        Test passes when AMS has results close to OVMS and OpenVino benchmark app.

        <b>Steps:</b>
        1. Prepare model for AMS - model param.
        2. Prepare config.json for AMS - config param.
        3. Run OpenVino benchmark app and get response time.
        4. Run OVMS and get response time.
        5. Run AMS and get response time.
        6. Compare response time for those services.
        7. Save results.
